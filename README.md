# ShuffleAndSort
A demo for shuffling and sorting Numbered Tiles.  
I wrote this as a solution for an interview question for the Organization that I am / was attending interviews for at the time.  
I went ahead and had some fun with it. I will eventually keep modifying it in future with more interesting stuffs, probably will include a mini game next time.  

**To run the code:** Download **src** and click **index.html** inside it.  

**Tech Stack:** HTML 5, ES 6, CSS 3.  

**Shuffle Algorithm:**  **The algorithm is based on _Fisherâ€“Yates shuffle_ - Source : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle**  
Step 1 - While looping in a descending order...  
Step 2 - I am taking a random index between (including) the loop index and the lowest index (0).  
Step 3 - Then swap the elements between the random index and the loop index.  
Step 4 - In the next loop, ignore the previous index and continue from Step 2.  
Step 5 - After the whole Tiles array is shuffled, generate the DOM (tileMaker) and resize UI (resizeTiles).  

**Sorting Algorithm:** I am using the **Compare Function** logic - **_return (a - b)_**

# Pssk! Bonus : There are Fun Stuffs somewhere in there. Do check it out! Try hovering and clicking the Tiles. Cheers! Happy Learning!
